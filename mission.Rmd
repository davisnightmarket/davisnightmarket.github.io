# GOALS

## Overarching goal

### Community-based food waste recovery and redistribution that can be replicated anywhere

The overarching aim of our organization is to ignite a movement of environmentally sustainable and inclusive food waste recovery and redistribution that can be replicated anywhere, empowering communities to close the gap between food waste and food insecurity.

### Replicate this in your community 

Check out our [DIY tutorials and guidelines](https://davisnightmarket.github.io/diy) to get started with Night Market in your own community!!! 

## Local goals

### 1. Decrease food waste
### 2. Increase stigma-free food access
### 3. Promote environmental sustainability
### 4. Build and empower community
### 5. Bring awareness and educate about food waste, food insecurity and sustainability.

We lower the barriers involved in both food donation and collection, creating radically accessible community-level food redistribution networks. In contrast to other food recovery organizations, **we do not require proof of need for community members to receive food donations**, thus reducing social stigma and barriers associated with food access. The goal is to encourage people to view collecting excess food as a positive experience and to reduce the stigma around food insecurity, all while dramatically increasing access. The **food recoveries we perform are as sustainable as possible** as we use bike carts for cargo and transportation and compostable waxed carton boxes for packaging. In this way, we also bring environmental awareness to the issues associated with food waste and transportation. Operating at a hyperlocal scale, we are able to recover and quickly redistribute nutritious food that might be beneath the quantity threshold for larger organizations.
